## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that background images that are supposed to cover a complete page are a pain in the ***. Even tough I try to organize them close to the designs, as soon as the screen changes in width or height they are completeley lost. In this case the designs where made with 800px height but normal 1440px screens have a height of 900px. So when the height is change the background image changes completely.

I learned to place a circle around an icon and preserve its pattern even though the icon is not a perfect square.

### Continued development

I need to continue developing the background image skills. I believe I have improved in time and quality of work but a lot of studying and practice needs to be done in order to fulfill my quality control.
Projects that have been performed have been a really good way to practice skills, and now I think I can continue improving them  while adding some JS into the mixture.
